1. Get a list from the client
    - Ask the user for the name of the first movie and check if it's validity(Need at least one valid movie)
    - Continue asking for more movies if the client chooses to share

2. Use Cosine Similarity
    - Compare the movies chosen by the client and the movies from the database and find the cosine similarity.
    - When given a list from the user we might have to create a vector from the average or the sum of the cosine similariy for each of the movies.
